# Angular Weather App

Welcome to the Angular Weather App! This project is a web application that allows users to view the weather of any city. The application fetches weather data from a third-party API, providing real-time weather information. Additionally, dynamic images are used to represent weather conditions, enhancing the user experience.

## Features

- **City Weather Information:** Users can enter the name of a city and get detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

- **Dynamic Images:** The application dynamically changes images based on the current weather conditions, providing visual cues for temperature ranges, weather patterns, and more.

- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 2+:** The project is built using the Angular framework, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase.

- **Third-Party API:** Weather data is fetched from a third-party API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

- **Dynamic Image Loading:** Images are loaded dynamically based on the weather conditions, enhancing the visual appeal of the application.
